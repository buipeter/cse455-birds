# The Problem

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying the species of birds by analyzing the characteristics present in an image. By accomplishing this, the aim is to create a sense of familiarity with these magnificent flying creatures, which have undergone diverse adaptations over millions of years, paralleling the evolution of humans and becoming one of the most varied animal groups on Earth, encompassing over 5,000 distinct species.
